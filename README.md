# Recommendations-with-IBM


In this Project, you will be putting your recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. 


You may either submit your notebook through the workspace here, or you may work from your local machine and submit through the next page.  Either way assure that your code passes the project [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2322/view).  **Please save regularly.**

By following the table of contents, you will build out a number of different methods for making recommendations that can be used for different situations. 


## Table of Contents

I. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#Exploratory-Data-Analysis)<br>
II. [Rank Based Recommendations](#Rank)<br>
III. [User-User Based Collaborative Filtering](#User-User)<br>
IV. [Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)](#Content-Recs)<br>
V. [Matrix Factorization](#Matrix-Fact)<br>
VI. [Extras & Concluding](#conclusions)

At the end of the Project, you will find directions for how to submit your work.  Let's get started by importing the necessary libraries and reading in the data.
